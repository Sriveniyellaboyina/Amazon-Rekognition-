# 🚀 Amazon Rekognition – Custom Labels Project

## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels** to train and evaluate a machine learning model with a custom dataset stored in Amazon S3.  
The trained model can recognize specific objects and categories based on the dataset provided, making it useful for real-world recognition tasks.



## 🛠️ AWS Services Used
- **Amazon S3** → Storage for training and testing datasets  
- **Amazon Rekognition (Custom Labels)** → Model training and evaluation  
- **IAM (Identity & Access Management)** → Secure permissions and access control

## 📊 Results
- Model was successfully trained on the dataset.  
- Performance was measured using **Precision, Recall, and F1 Score**.  
- Model artifacts were stored in the associated S3 bucket.  
- Final model is ready to be deployed in recognition workflows.
